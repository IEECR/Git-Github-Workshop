By Bence Mitlasoczki & Lena J. Gschossmann

------------------------------------------
This repository contains material for a workshop teaching the basic usage of the version control system (VCS) Git and Github for scientists.
It has been prepared for an in-person workshop but is self-explanatory and can be followed autonomosly.

Note: The workshop is tailored for the use of Visual Studio Code. However, most of the modules require working with Git's command-line interface and could thus be done using another IDE or the git bash terminal.

All prerequisites for the workshop are listed below. Furthermore, no coding skills are required in session 1.


------------------------------------------
**Session 1** encompasses following 5 modules:
- Module 1  Setting it up (10 min)
- Module 2	Local version control with Git (30 min)
- Module 3	Remote version control with Git & Github (30 min)

- Module 5	What makes a good repository (30 min)
