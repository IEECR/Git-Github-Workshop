---------- MODULE 1: Setting it up ----------

Welcome to the first module.

You will set up everything you need to work with Git and Github using VSCode and clone a repository
using the Git command-line interface  (CLI); it means you will work from the terminal.

---------- Steps:
1. If not done yet: Install git (https://www.git-scm.com/downloads).
2. If not done yet: Install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. Connect git and github: Open a terminal and enter following:
    git config user.email "email_of_your_github_profile"
    git config user.name "your_github_profile_name"
4. Find the repository we prepared on Github: https://github.com/IEECR/Github-Workshop
   There is a green button 'Code', click on it and copy the repositories URL.
5. In VSCode, open a terminal ('Terminal' tab on top > 'New Termial'), this is from where we will work for now.
6. First, we need to move in the terminal to the directory where the repository should be saved (find some helpful commands below).
7. Then, type 'git clone url-to-repo'.
    A directory with the repository's name will be created in the directory your terminal points to and the repository will be saved there.
    Note: You can change the name of the directory it is saved to: 'git clone url-to-repo name-you-choose'
8. Move into your repository's directory and type 'git status'.
    Note: this gives you an overview of the changes tracked by git.
9. If you wonder, what the difference is when you download the zip file instead of cloning the repository:
   Try it (but do not save it in the directory of your repository)!
   Try the 'git status' command...

---------- Change directory from the terminal:
    Windows:    'dir' -> list all directories and files in current directory
                'cd ..' -> move into the parent directory
                'cd name-of-dir' -> move into a directory that is a subdirectory of the current one
                'name-of-drive:' -> change to another drive
    Linux:      'pwd' -> shows your current location
                'ls -l' -> lists the folders and files in the current directory
                'cd ..' -> move into parent directory
                'cd name-of-dir' -> move into subdirectory named name-of-dir
                'cd /absolute/path/to/file' -> move to any folder specified by the absolute path (example: /home/user/Downloads/)
