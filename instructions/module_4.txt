---------- MODULE 4: Use VS Code Git integragion - The easy way ----------

Create a repository online and clone it. Add a readme file in VSCode and enter your name, stage, commit, sync.
To do that, you will now use the Git integration for VSCode, so it will be buttons instead of commands.

---------- Steps:
1. In the browser, create a new private repository (you did that already in module 3).
2. Copy the URL of the repository.
3. In VSCode, open a new window ('File' > 'New Window').
4. Go to the 'Source Control' tab in the menu bar at the left side of the window.
   This gives you control over Git commands. You can stage files here, commit, etc.
   Click on 'Clone Repository'.
   Alternative: after opening the new VSCode window, you also see 'Clone Git Repository...' in the main window and can click on that.
5. Enter the URL you copied (that points to your remote repository) into the editable text field
   at the top of the VSCode window and select 'Clone from URL'.
6. Select a directory, where it should be saved at, open it in VSCode (and trust the author).
7. If there is not yet a README.md file in your repository, add one.
8. Write your name into the (newly created or already existing) README.md.
9. In VSCode, go to the Source Control tab. You see a section 'Changes' and a 'M' behind the README.md.
   This indicates that a file that is tracked by Git has been modified.
10. Stage the file: click on the small '+' behind the file (to stage this file) or behind 'Changes' (to stage all files).
    The file now should be listed under 'Staged Changes'
11. Enter a commit message and click on 'Commit'.
12. Push the commit by clicking on 'Sync' (this first performs a pull and then push command).
